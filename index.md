## About Me

I am a Research Engineer at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), affiliated with the [SPriNT-AI Lab (Security, Privacy and Trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.sprintai.org/) and the [CERT Lab (Collaboration, Efficiency, Responsibility and Trust)](https://github.com/CERT-Lab). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karthik Nandakumar](https://cse.msu.edu/~nandakum/) and co-advised by [Prof. Praneeth Vepakomma](https://sites.mit.edu/praneeth/), and also fortunate to collaborate closely with [Fahad Shamshad](https://fahadshamshad.github.io).

I recently obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Vision from [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), under the supervision of [Prof. Muhammad Haris Khan](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/muhammad-haris-khan/) and [Prof. Karthik Nandakumar](https://cse.msu.edu/~nandakum/). Prior to that, I pursued my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology Durgapur (NIT Durgapur)](https://nitdgp.ac.in/). I have also worked as a research intern with [Prof. Ram Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bDj0BUEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Jadavpur University.


<!-- I am passionate about Computer Vision, Trustworthy Machine Learning, reading books, Cubing, and Basketball. -->

## Research Interests

I work at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Biometrics**, and **Privacy**, developing models and methods to prevent the misuse of personal data in identity-aware applications. Broadly, I am interested in building AI systems that are secure, efficient, and applicable in real-world scenarios rather than remaining confined to code and conferences without practical application.

Previously, I focused on calibrating **Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs)** to improve the trustworthiness of their confidence estimates and ensure safer deployment in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.
