## About Me

I am a Computer Vision graduate student at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) with a 100% scholarship, previously I pursued my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology Durgapur](https://nitdgp.ac.in/). I am passionate about Computer Vision, Deep Learning, reading books, Cubing, and Basketball.
## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in calibrating deep learning models to make them more usable in real-life scenarios. My focus is on refining these advanced models to ensure their predictions are not only accurate but also confident so that they are applicable in practical settings, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world utility.
